<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>For the tutorial, we will use the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/gustavomodelli/covid-community-measures">COVID Community Measures</a> dataset from Kaggle. We hope that you will be able to generalize the function we covered to be applicable to your own dataset. The current dataset contains Community Mobility Reports describing community activities in a variety of settings from Google and the incidence of COVID-19 diagnosis and fatalities from John Hopkins CSSE.</p>
<p>Community activity is defined as the change in activity from the baseline days. A baseline day is the median value from the 5‑week period between January 3rd to February 6th, 2020.</p>
<h2 id="loading-the-data">Loading the Data</h2>
<h3 id="please-refer-to-our-blogpost-on-how-to-automate-your-data-loading.-you-can-check-out-the-post-here">Please refer to our blogpost on how to automate your data loading. <a href="https://s-gluck.github.io/funprog_blog/posts/2020-05-11-blog_post_one/">You can check out the post here</a></h3>
<p>To create a function that can read in our dataframe and output descriptives, we will need the following packages. If you have not already isntalled them, please use <code>install.packages(" ")</code> prior to calling <code>library()</code>.</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<pre class="r"><code>
#At later time, identify what aspects of each library are used for the function
library(tidyverse) 
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(purrr)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Once the data is loaded, we can look at the dataframe by calling <code>reactable()</code> on our dataframe. Notice that you can sort each column by clicking on the column header.</p>

<p>For this dataset, it would be helpful to create a ‘week’ variable that extracts each day of the week, so we can group our descriptives by week which would allow us to examine for example the average change in activities across weeks for different settings. Here, we’ve also created a ‘day_of_week’ variable to double-check our work.</p>
<p>If you are working with date-time variables in your data, the <a href="%22https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/">lubridate</a> package is quite powerful at manipulating date-time data.</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<pre class="r"><code>

<p>Now that we’ve created our week variable, we can use <code>tidyr::nest</code> to group our dataset by week, by country, or both. This will allow us to loop our function through each grouping variable and provide unique descriptives for each.</p>
<p>We will nest our data by the variables <code>country</code> and <code>week</code></p>

<p>In order to figure out how to create a function that can be used for any variable in a dataset, we first need to do it for one.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>mean</code> is a base R function.</li>
<li><code>d2</code> is our nested data set.</li>
<li><code>data</code> is a dataframe that contains all our other variables, for each country and week. You’ll notice there’s a different dataset for Argentina week1, Argentina week2, and so on.</li>
<li><code>[[1]]</code> says: give me the contents within data</li>
<li><code>$residential</code> specifies which variable within data we are interested in.</li>
</ul>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<pre class="r"><code>
mean(d2$data[[1]]$residential)</code></pre>
<pre><code>
[1] 1.674143</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Next, we can attempt to loop through each cell in the ‘data’ column (that is, grouped by country and week) to find the residential means for each.</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<pre class="r"><code>

<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Let’s take the functions we wrote in steps 2 and 3. We can change the object names to make them more descriptive. Above we used <code>tmp</code> because that was the specific dataset we were interested in making numeric. Now we can generalize to any dataset by replacing <code>tmp</code> with <code>df</code>:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>numeric_df &lt;- df[map_lgl(df, is.numeric)]</code></p>
<p>Here, we are using <code>df</code>; once we put this mini-function into our larger function, <code>df</code> will refer to all the datasets within our nested dataframe (<code>d2</code>). (This will make more sense later)</p>
<p>Next, we’ve broadened the function from step 3 so that it can take any dataframe and function as an input, and loop that function throughout the dataset.</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<pre class="r"><code>
#estimating just one function
est_one_fun &lt;- function(df, f) {
 map_dbl(df, ~f(.x))
}</code></pre>
</div>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Almost there! Now let’s create our larger function. We’ll assign it to the name <code>descriptives</code>. Our arguments are:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p><code>df</code> = placeholder for a dataframe.</p></li>
<li><p><code>funs_to_apply</code> = a list of functions. We can call this anything. Here we are saying that the list of functions we want is what we created earlier, <code>listof_fun</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<pre class="r"><code>
descriptives &lt;- function(df, funs_to_apply = listof_fun) {</code></pre>
</div>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Great, now let’s add in the <code>numeric_df</code> function we created in step 5.</li>
</ol>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<pre class="r"><code>
descriptives &lt;- function(df, funs_to_apply = listof_fun) {
  
  numeric_df &lt;- df[map_lgl(df, is.numeric)] </code></pre>
</div>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>Now comes the tricky part. We will use <code>map_df</code> AND our <code>est_one_fun</code> function within our <code>descriptives</code> function. Let’s focus just on this for now. We are saying: loop through each of our operations in <code>funs_to_apply</code>, so that we can apply the <code>est_one_fun</code> function to use each of those operations on our <code>numeric_df</code>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">

  map_df(funs_to_apply, ~est_one_fun(numeric_df, .x)) </code></pre>
</div>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>Phew! Now let’s use a bit of <code>dplyr</code> code to make our output look nicer. We are using <code>mutate</code> to create a vector with each of the column names. Then we are using <code>select</code> to change the order of the output so that our names column (<code>place</code>) is first.</li>
