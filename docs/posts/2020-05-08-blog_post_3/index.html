<p>Let’s say we want to create a separate plot for mobility trends in each country. First, we need to <code>group_by</code> country and <code>nest()</code> the rest of the data. This creates a list of tibbles, one for each country. I’ve called <code>reactable()</code> here so that we can return a simple, interactive table to see the results of nesting.</p>

<h3 id="about-pmap-pmap.l-.f">About <code>pmap()</code>: pmap(.l, .f, …)</h3>
<p><code>pmap(.l, .f, ...)</code> is a variation of <code>map()</code> which allows us to apply a function to multiple vectors simultaneously. According to the <a href="https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map2.html">help documentation</a>, it takes 2 or more arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>.d = a list of vectors (such as a data frame).</li>
<li>.f = A function, formula, or vector (not necessarily atomic). <em>In the example below, we’ve supplied another vector.</em></li>
<li>… = Additional arguments passed on to the mapped function. <strong>This is what makes <code>pmap()</code> so flexible!</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-plotting">Getting started with plotting</h2>
<p>In the syntax below, you’ll see that the first vector listed corresponds to ..1 (in this case, country) and the second vector listed (data) corresponds to ..2. The vectors listed in <code>aes()</code> are from within the data, which we specifed with ..2. For this example, we’ll create one plot for each country, for just one of the mobility categories (workplaces).</p>

<p>What if we wanted to see plots for <em>all</em> mobility categories, not just workplaces? We can apply the same logic as above, but first nest by both country <em>and</em> mobility category.</p>
<p>In order to do so, we’ll first have to restructure the data so that mobility category is it’s own column. This can be done using <code>pivot_longer()</code>:</p>

<p>Now we can use the same code structure as before for plotting. <code>pmap()</code> is super useful here because we can <code>list()</code> any number of columns. Note that here the first argument for <code>ggplot()</code> is now <code>..3</code>, referring to the 3rd item (“data”) in the <code>pmap(list())</code>. Also, the <code>aes()</code> now calls for perc_change instead of parks or residential, etc., because that is the name of the column after using pivot_longer.</p>

<h1 id="creating-a-function-to-plot-linear-model">Creating a function to plot linear model</h1>
<p>So far, we’ve only explored mobility trends, not mobility trends in relation to infections. And, we’ve illustrated one strategy for applying a function to multiple vectors - parellel iteration. Another strategy that is especially useful for processes that you find yourself repeating is to write a function yourself! Here’s an example of writing a function to plot linear models of mobility trends by infection data.</p>
<p>Before writing a function, it’s usually helpful to just write the code that you would normally use to achieve the result you want. Here is the code for plotting a linear model:</p>
<p>(first I unnested the data)</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<pre class="r"><code>
d_unnest &lt;- by_country_mobil_cat %&gt;%
  unnest(data)</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<pre class="r"><code>
lm_total_mob &lt;- lm(perc_change ~ total_cases, data = d_unnest)
call &lt;- as.character(match.call()) # for customized title in labs() 
plot(perc_change ~ total_cases, data = d_unnest)
abline(lm_total_mob)</code></pre>
<p><img src="blog_post_3_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="624" /></p>
</div>
<p>Now let’s use that code to generalize it to a function. This function will have 3 arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>the data frame (df)</li>
<li>the mobility category of interest (mobil_cat), e.g. parks, residential</li>
<li>the infection variable of interest (infect_var), e.g. total_cases, fatalities</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s the function:</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<pre class="r"><code>
plot_lm &lt;- function(df, mobil_cat, infect_var) {
  lm_mob_by_infect &lt;- lm(mobil_cat ~ infect_var, data = df)
  plot(mobil_cat ~ infect_var, data = df)
  abline(lm_mob_by_infect)
}</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Test <code>plot_lm()</code> on one mobility category (parks):</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<pre class="r"><code>
plot_lm(d, d$parks, d$total_cases)</code></pre>
<p><img src="blog_post_3_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="624" /></p>
</div>
<h1 id="using-map-to-loop-through-our-plot_lm-function">Using map() to loop through our plot_lm() function</h1>
<p>We can use map() to loop through each mobilility category column to plot a lm for each.</p>
<p>map(.d, .f) takes a dataframe argument and a function argument.</p>
<p>Here, the ~ means “apply this function” and is paired with the .x argument indicating “over all columns”. For the data argument in map(), I’ve selected only the columns I want to loop through: d[5:9].</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<pre class="r"><code>
map(d[5:9], ~plot_lm(d, .x, d$total_cases))</code></pre>
<p><img src="blog_post_3_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="624" /><img src="blog_post_3_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-11-2.png" width="624" /><img src="blog_post_3_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-11-3.png" width="624" /><img src="blog_post_3_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-11-4.png" width="624" /><img src="blog_post_3_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-11-5.png" width="624" /></p>
</div>
<p>This is just to demonstrate creating a function and using map() with ~ and .x to loop through that function. Of course, these plots would be more useful with customized title and axes labels, as shown above.</p>
<p>Interesting to see how different the 2nd plot is from the rest! This plot corresponds to “residential” mobility – while the other plots show decreasing mobility to parks, workplaces, etc., this plot shows a large increase in people staying at home as total infections rose.</p>
